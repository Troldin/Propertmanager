# Property-manager
Reupload from private university repository
Group Project! unfortunately repository was private so I couldnt show my React skills ;D, i was responsible for all of front end and part of backend.
Its definitely not perfect use of React but after that project i know why. If i have to do this one more time i would use a lot more small components!
